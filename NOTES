 
 It would be cool if people could share those infographics on facebook with a single button click.
   Good thing for an intern to do.

 There are 12 dudes in each row in the People chart.


 Image upload is failing part-way through sometimes

 Link from Grace's picture on the homepage.

 
 Should we put in place some infrastructure for an "invitation-only" or "beta phase" launch?


 Create the rest of Grace's data...

 Security and access crontrol audit for all actions.
 Make sure people can't upload images that are too big or too small
 Make sure people can't save data that's ridiculously long.

 Let people make profiles to apply for scholarships

 List the scholarshipable opportunities (maybe a 2nd link under Education Provided).   Or opportunities to get hours.

 Make mission statement link to mission page.  Or maybe it should be an explanation page...



Data for Grace:

["I fixed a picture in my website that wasn't positioned the way I wanted it to be.", "Downloaded Gimp. Used it to knock the background out of a picture.", "Grace downloaded Gimp and did some simple image manipulation to change the logo for her website.  This is good because I believe web design and web development should go hand-in-hand.", "Teacher note: Grace downloaded Gimp and did some simple image manipulation to change the logo for her website.  This is good because I believe web design and web development should go hand-in-hand.", "I found a new program that I can use to write code in at school.", "Used javascript functions to change the color of words.", "Learnred about refactoring: making your code shorter but having it do the same thing.", "Teacher: Grace started learning about javascript functions, which is a very complex topic.  This is the second time we've talked about functions before, and she's definitely understanding it better.  She was able to write her own function today with some help (siab).  I would guess we need to practice functions for about 4 more hours before she can start writing her own."]
