Stuff I've decided on and built into the app (but which I might forget).


Stakeholders:
  Students
  Teachers
  Donors
  Administrators


Application Business process:
    Donations are made into the main pool

    A teacher "applies" to be a teacher
    A student "applies" to be a student
    We (internally) put students on some kind of schedule -- based on their needs, location, experience, etc.
    We contact teachers in their area and set up the sessions, curriculum, etc.  Or we set up remote sessions.
    We create the student hours in advance.  We attach the teacher to the hour (via Ownership tagged with "Teacher" -- see teacher!() API call).  We wire up the dollars from the donations to the hour.
      We wait for teacher and student to log their notes, link to their code/videos, etc.
    Meanwhile, students can log their own hours as long as it appears to be beneficial.  We'll have someone internally review the student's progress probably.  Remote mentoring...
